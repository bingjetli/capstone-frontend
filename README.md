# Fullstack Restaurant Reservation Frontend

This repository contains the capstone project for my Humber Summer 2024 Web Development program.

This is a fully-interactable frontend hosted on Vercel's serverless hosting platform.

This project is currently under active development.

# Live Hosted Demo

The live demo can be access using the following link : https://humber-capstone-restaurant-reservation-frontend-eo8ngp7z7.vercel.app/

NOTE: Because the backend api is currently hosted on Render, there is typically a 1-2 minute boot up time for the frontend to connect to the backend due to their free tier.
