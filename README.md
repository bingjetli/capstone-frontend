# Fullstack Restaurant Reservation Frontend

This repository contains the capstone project for my Humber Summer 2024 Web Development program.

This is a fully-interactable frontend hosted on Vercel's serverless hosting platform. At the time of writing, it contains all the features of the MVP which includes CRUD actions on Reservations. It also partially implements the reservation requests features listed in the original requirements document.

This project is currently under active development.

# Live Hosted Demo

The live demo can be access using the following link : https://humber-capstone-restaurant-reservation-frontend-eo8ngp7z7.vercel.app/

NOTE: Because the backend api is currently hosted on Render, there is typically a 1-2 minute boot up time for the frontend to connect to the backend due to their free tier.
